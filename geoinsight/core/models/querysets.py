    Models using this queryset (via `as_manager()`) must define a `project_filter_path` class
    attribute:

    * A lookup string (e.g. `"project"`, `"dataset__project"`) that resolves to the Project FK/M2M
      from the model.
    * `None` to skip filtering (`filter_by_projects` returns the full queryset).

    Models may also set `project_filter_allow_null = True` to include rows where the
    `project_filter_path` leads to a NULL FK (i.e. not associated with any Project). By default,
    only rows that have an associated Project are returned.
