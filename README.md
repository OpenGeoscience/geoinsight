# UVDAT: Urban Visualization and Data Analysis Toolkit

Supports data-driven research for the growth, progress, and welfare of urban areas to enable and inform decisions and policy.

_Currently in Phase 1 of development_

### Initial Setup
1. Run `docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py migrate`
2. Run `docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py createsuperuser`
   and follow the prompts to create your own user
3. Run `docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py populate` to use sample data

### Run Application
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Access the site, starting at http://localhost:8000/admin/ and http://localhost:8080/
3. When finished, use `Ctrl+C`

### Application Maintenance
Occasionally, new package dependencies or schema changes will necessitate
maintenance. To non-destructively update your development stack at any time:
1. Run `docker-compose pull`
2. Run `docker-compose build --pull --no-cache`
3. Run `docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py migrate`

## Testing
### Initial Setup
tox is used to execute all tests.
tox is installed automatically with the `dev` package extra.

When running the "Develop with Docker" configuration, all tox commands must be run as
`docker-compose run --rm django tox`; extra arguments may also be appended to this form.

### Running Tests
Run `tox` to launch the full test suite.

Individual test environments may be selectively run.
This also allows additional options to be be added.
Useful sub-commands include:
* `tox -e lint`: Run only the style checks
* `tox -e type`: Run only the type checks
* `tox -e test`: Run only the pytest-driven tests

To automatically reformat all code to comply with
some (but not all) of the style checks, run `tox -e format`.
